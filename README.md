# PyDOS
This is a project wrote in Python 3 to make a DOS-like I/O system.

Made by DeBeast591

# Requirements (These are simple)
> Terminal, Nano
# Required Modules
> OS

# Notes
> With the OS module, I used Linux commands. I will make functions for the os.system() commands so they can be easily replaced for your OS's commands.
